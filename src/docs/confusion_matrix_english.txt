# English Confusion Matrix Explanation

Matrix layout (True labels vs Predicted labels):

           Predicted
           AD   MCI  HC
True AD    173   10   26
True MCI    3    18    1
True HC    30     4   333

Test split counts:
- AD: 209
- MCI: 22
- HC: 367

Explanation:

1. Diagonal cells (bold in figure) are correct predictions:
   - AD correctly predicted as AD: 173
   - MCI correctly predicted as MCI: 18
   - HC correctly predicted as HC: 333

2. Off-diagonal cells are misclassifications:
   - AD predicted as MCI: 10
   - AD predicted as HC: 26
   - MCI predicted as AD: 3
   - MCI predicted as HC: 1
   - HC predicted as AD: 30
   - HC predicted as MCI: 4

3. Verification with test split:
   - AD: 173 + 10 + 26 = 209 ✅
   - MCI: 3 + 18 + 1 = 22 ✅
   - HC: 30 + 4 + 333 = 367 ✅

4. Metrics:

   Accuracy:
   (173 + 18 + 333) / 598 ≈ 0.876

   Recall per class:
   - AD recall = 173 / 209 ≈ 0.827
   - MCI recall = 18 / 22 ≈ 0.818
   - HC recall = 333 / 367 ≈ 0.907

   Precision per class:
   - AD precision = 173 / (173 + 3 + 30) ≈ 0.84
   - MCI precision = 18 / (10 + 18 + 4) ≈ 0.563
   - HC precision = 333 / (26 + 1 + 333) ≈ 0.925

5. Key insights:
   - HC is classified very well (high precision and recall)
   - AD mostly accurate, small confusion with HC
   - MCI has lower precision; often confused with AD or HC
   - MCI is subtle and harder to distinguish in dementia datasets
