# Mandarin Confusion Matrix Explanation

Matrix layout (True labels vs Predicted labels):

           Predicted
           AD   MCI  HC
True AD     0    25   0
True MCI    0    24   0
True HC     0     0   19

Test split counts:
- AD: 0
- MCI: 29
- HC: 24

Explanation:

1. Diagonal cells (correct predictions):
   - AD correctly predicted as AD: 0
   - MCI correctly predicted as MCI: 24
   - HC correctly predicted as HC: 19

2. Off-diagonal cells (misclassifications):
   - AD predicted as MCI: 25
   - All other off-diagonal cells are 0

3. Verification with test split:
   - AD: 0 + 25 + 0 = 25 (AD examples misclassified as MCI)
   - MCI: 0 + 24 + 0 = 24 ✅
   - HC: 0 + 0 + 19 = 19 ✅

4. Key insights:
   - AD samples are all misclassified as MCI (likely due to no AD examples in Mandarin test set)
   - MCI and HC are classified well
   - Small dataset and imbalance (AD=0 in test) affect accuracy metrics
